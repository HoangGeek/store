## 💾 What is this?

Welcome to the **store**.  
Here, the owner uploads images freely, using GitHub as a totally legit image hosting service.  
No fancy code, no secret payloads, just pixels and bytes.

## 🚀 Why?

Because sometimes you just need a place to stash your memes, screenshots, or random cat pics.  
And what better place than GitHub?  
(Thanks, GitHub, for the free storage! 🙏)

## ⚠️ Note

- This repo does **not** do anything useful.
- It's just a playground for image uploads.
- If you found this, congrats, you are now in on the joke.
